What Is Kona
-------------

Kona is a wiki written in Perl based on DBIx::Class, Plack::Request,
with a bit of my own magic tossed in.  Its primary reason for existing
is split between wanting to make something generic like a wiki in this 
type of an environment and my dissatisfaction in current wiki products.

Kona?
----------

Its name got based on this conversation:

    <SymKat>  Name my project, what do I call a wiki?
    <Friend>  Kona.
    <SymKat>  After the coffee?
    <Friend>  Yes, Hawaiian, wiki, hula hula.
    <SymKat>  I think you have won.
